# VEBTree
Implementation of Van Emde Boas tree (VEBTree). 
If the side heap has a range larger than the base case, then it also needs to be a VEB tree. The implementation includes insert(), findNext(), deleteMin(), printSideHeap(), printContents(), extractMin(), ...

The operations insert, extractMin, dseleteMin, and findNext are performed in O(log log n).
